## Build tasks

#### all

Run all the things!

    gulp all
    
You'll probably want to use this whenever you pull to get any new dependencies, and before you push to make sure you've
recorded all your dependencies, formatted your code appropriately and haven't caused any regressions.

#### default

Bundles the styles and scripts. 

    gulp

If you're not using the `watch` task you'll probably want to use this task whenever you change the code.

#### watch

Listens for changes to your style, script and package.json files and bundles/installs them when they change.

    gulp watch

You'll want to use this whenever you're making changes to the code.

#### clean

Deletes all the generated files from the `./dist` directory.

    gulp clean
    
Run this task when you want to re-bundle styles and scripts from a clean slate.

#### install

Install all the dependencies for your styles and scripts.

    gulp install
    
You'll probably want to run this after you or someone else makes changes the package.json file.

#### test

    gulp test

Run all the tests in PhantomJS.

#### debug

    gulp debug

Run a test server so you can debug the tests in the browser.

#### optimise
